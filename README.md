# Alex Turnbull Portfolio
Technical developer with 5+ years of professional experience as a Unity developer creating immersive and interactive applications in a wide range of disciplines.

Background and interest in Game Development. Partook in the Tranzfuser development programme. Previously lead a small indie team called Monkey Hat Games with a published game on Armor Games.

Projects below showcase work I've done during my time at University and early professional career.

<br>
<br>

## Hatchapon (Windows Game) (Unity / C#) [Monkey Hat Games]
###### Final year Group Project, this was then taking forward to developed on further for the Tranzfuzer programme.

Hatchapon is a co-op 3D physics platformer about two ducks who solve puzzles, collect eggs from islands, and build up their ranch.

*Majority of code in this game was done by me - supported by a team member* 

#### Won best game at Game Anglia Indie Showcase 2019.

###### Initally was made during Jamfuser 2020, a 72 hour game jam hosted by Tranzfuser as part of the programme - the theme was "Leap".
DreamHopper is about the story of a grasshopper who can't jump - but gains the ability to leap through his dreams.

*Vast majority of code in this game was done by me - supported by a team member* 

#### Won best game of the game jam and was then published on Armor Games.

## 5G Edge XR (Unity / C#) [BT Group]
###### DCMS Government funded research project, exploring how 5G networks, in combination with cloud graphics processing units, can provide immersive experiences.

I was the lead Unity developer creating 5 proof of concepts to demonstrate the capabilities of 5G paired with GPU compute over CloudXR.

#### Won 2 awards at IBC 2022: Best Technical Paper, Content Everywhere Innovation Award

## Always a Bigger Fish (Mobile Game) (Unity / C#)
###### First year Group Project which is local 2 player mobile fishing based game where players compete to obtain the best haul of fish.

*Source Code can be found here: https://github.com/alex-turnbull/portfolio/tree/master/AlwaysABiggerFish/Game%20Project%20-%20Unity/Fishing/Assets/Scripts*

*Code in this game was shared between myself and another programmer, no direct script was written by one of us exactly.*

This was part of a 12 week project in which we had to make a game that fit a brief that was given to us. The brief we had for this project was to: "Create a simple touch local multiplayer game on a single mobile device".

## Past Echoes (Windows Game) (Unity / C#)
###### Second year Group Project in which we created a story based adventure/exploration game where the majority of visuals are removed and the focus is on sound to learn and interact to progress through the story.

*Source Code can be found here: https://github.com/alex-turnbull/portfolio/tree/master/PastEchoes/Group4Final/Assets/Scripts*

*All Code in this game was done by me.*

This game was my second year 12 week group project piece. We again had to follow a brief given to us and build a solution to fit. The brief for this project was to: "Create a single player game, considering a certain genre and the mechanics integral to it - removing a specified mechanic and substitude for a new refined solution".

*Playable at: https://alexturnbull.itch.io/past-echoes-group-4*

## Interactive AI Agents (C++)
###### A second year project demonstrating the creation of various AI implementation including: Finite State Machines, Steering Behaviours and PathFinding.

*Source Code can be found here: https://github.com/alex-turnbull/portfolio/tree/master/InteractiveAIAgents/InteractiveAgents2*

This project here demonstrates the use of various AI implementation and how they work and all interact with eachother. Here we see a Pirate using Pathfinding to navigate the island looking for treasure (all controlled through a Finite State Machine) whilst a Skeleton makes use of Steering behaviours to navigate and track the Pirate down.

## 2D Game Engine (C++)
###### A second year project which is an implementation of a 2D Game Engine using SFML and Box2D.

*Source Code can be found here: https://github.com/alex-turnbull/portfolio/tree/master/s192255-GameEngine/s192255-GameEngine/Source*

As part of second year, we were tasked to create a basic implementation of a 2D Game Engine. We had to consider the following:
* Rendering 			- SFML
* User Input			- SFML
* Resource Management	- Self Handled
* Scene Management		- Self Handled
* Physics				- Box2D

Third party libraries handled most of the basic principles for the engine however all of the seperate parts of the engine had to be developed from scratch and they all come together to demonstrate a very basic proof of concept - showing a scene can be loaded in the game world with a playable character that can interact with the environment.

My Game Engine was created in mind for a 2D Platforming/Puzzle game, where the player would have to move an object to a certain place in order to progress. Gameplay wasn't fully developed however concept is there.

## Huffman Encoding (C#)
###### A small program I created as part of my first year that takes in an input string and converts it into Huffman Code.

*Source Code can be found here: https://github.com/alex-turnbull/portfolio/tree/master/HuffmanEncoding/HuffmanEncoding*
