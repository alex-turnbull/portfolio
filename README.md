# Alex Turnbull Portfolio
**Here are various projects I have worked on during my time at University so far:**

Images/Gifs are provided where appropriate to help further demonstrate explanations. Each project will be included in this repo and source code will be linked for each project.

### Always a Bigger Fish (Mobile Game) (C#)
###### First year Group Project which is local 2 player mobile fishing based game where players compete to obtain the best haul of fish.

*Source Code can be found here: https://github.com/alex-turnbull/portfolio/tree/master/AlwaysABiggerFish/Game%20Project%20-%20Unity/Fishing/Assets/Scripts*

*Code in this game was shared between myself and another programmer, no direct script was written by one of us exactly.*

This was part of a 12 week project in which we had to make a game that fit a brief that was given to us. The brief we had for this project was to: "Create a simple touch local multiplayer game on a single mobile device".

### Past Echoes (Windows Game) (C#)
###### Second year Group Project in which we created a story based adventure/exploration game where the majority of visuals are removed and the focus is on sound to learn and interact to progress through the story.

*Source Code can be found here: https://github.com/alex-turnbull/portfolio/tree/master/PastEchoes/Group4Final/Assets/Scripts*

*All Code in this game was done by me.*

This game was my second year 12 week group project piece. We again had to follow a brief given to us and build a solution to fit. The brief for this project was to: "Create a single player game, considering a certain genre and the mechanics integral to it - removing a specified mechanic and substitude for a new refined solution".

*Playable at: https://alexturnbull.itch.io/past-echoes-group-4*

### Interactive AI Agents (C++)
###### A second year project demonstrating the creation of various AI implementation including: Finite State Machines, Steering Behaviours and PathFinding.

*Source Code can be found here: https://github.com/alex-turnbull/portfolio/tree/master/InteractiveAIAgents/InteractiveAgents2*

This project here demonstrates the use of various AI implementation and how they work and all interact with eachother. Here we see a Pirate using Pathfinding to navigate the island looking for treasure (all controlled through a Finite State Machine) whilst a Skeleton makes use of Steering behaviours to navigate and track the Pirate down.

### 2D Game Engine (C++)
###### A second year project which is an implementation of a 2D Game Engine using SFML and Box2D.

*Source Code can be found here: https://github.com/alex-turnbull/portfolio/tree/master/s192255-GameEngine/s192255-GameEngine/Source*

### Huffman Encoding (C#)
###### A small program I created as part of my first year that takes in an input string and converts it into Huffman Code.

*Source Code can be found here: https://github.com/alex-turnbull/portfolio/tree/master/HuffmanEncoding/HuffmanEncoding*
